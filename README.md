# Heat Calculator

## Overview

Welcome to the Heat Calculator project! This Python-based program is designed to calculate various heat-related values, including heat (Q), heat capacity (C), mass (m), and temperature change (ΔT). The calculations are based on fundamental physics formulas covered in high school physics courses.

## Features

- **Calculate Heat (Q):** Determine the amount of heat energy transferred.
- **Calculate Heat Capacity (C):** Compute the heat capacity of a substance.
- **Calculate Mass (m):** Find the mass of the substance involved in heat transfer.
- **Calculate Temperature Change (ΔT):** Evaluate the change in temperature due to heat transfer.
- **Calculate Final Temperature (T2):** Estimate the final temperature after heat transfer.

## Usage

This program is developed in Python and uses the `colorama` library for colored console output. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can run the program by executing the following command:

```sh
python heat_calculator.py
