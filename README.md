# HeatMaster

## Overview

Welcome to **HeatMaster**! This Python-based program is designed to calculate various heat-related values, including heat (Q), heat capacity (C), mass (m), and temperature change (ΔT). The calculations are based on fundamental physics formulas covered in high school physics courses.

## Features

- **Calculate Heat (Q):** Determine the amount of heat energy transferred.
- **Calculate Heat Capacity (C):** Compute the heat capacity of a substance.
- **Calculate Mass (m):** Find the mass of the substance involved in heat transfer.
- **Calculate Temperature Change (ΔT):** Evaluate the change in temperature due to heat transfer.
- **Calculate Final Temperature (T2):** Estimate the final temperature after heat transfer.

## Usage

This program is developed in Python and uses the `colorama` library for colored console output. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can run the program by executing the following command:

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heatmaster.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd heatmaster
```
Install the required packages:
```sh
pip install colorama
```
## How It Works
The HeatCalculator class contains methods to perform various calculations:

**calculate_c(Q, m, delta_T): Calculates heat capacity.
**calculate_Q(c, m, delta_T): Calculates heat energy.
**calculate_m(Q, c, delta_T): Calculates mass.
**calculate_delta_T(Q, c, m): Calculates temperature change.
**calculate_T2(Q, m, c, T1): Calculates the final temperature.
**The run method initiates the program, clearing the console and displaying introductory information.
